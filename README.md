# VA Portfolio

A portfolio template for Virtual Assistants, built with React and Vite.  
**This is a separate project from your main portfolio** — use a **new GitHub repo** for this one.

## New GitHub repo (do not use the same repo as your main portfolio)

1. Create a **new** repository on GitHub (e.g. `va-portfolio`).
2. In this folder, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: VA portfolio"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/va-portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `va-portfolio` with your GitHub username and repo name.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Customize for VA

- **Hero**: Name, title (e.g. Virtual Assistant), tagline.
- **About**: Your VA services and experience.
- **Growth**: VA-relevant skills (e.g. Admin, Data Entry, Social Media, Email Management).
- **Projects**: Past VA work or services offered.
- **Contact**: Your Formspree form or contact email.

## Deploy to Vercel

Import this repo (the **new** one) into Vercel so the VA portfolio has its own URL.
